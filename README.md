# intechopen.com webscraper
Downloads individual chapters from [intechopen](https://www.intechopen.com/) and merges it into a single ebook.

### Usage
Simply edit the `url` variable in the `__main__` section to the base url of the desired ebook.

### Remarks
The quality of ebooks turned out to be quite dissapointing in the end. I was looking for literature about specific topics, but most books in intechopen are just journals. I don't expect to use this script much in the future, so updates/fixes may be lacking.
